# Guidelines for Working in Groups Effectively

##  Before You Start

1. Mini Check-in
  - Talk with your group about how they are feeling that day/week. 
  - Is there anything going on in your life that may affect you?

2. Discuss your education goal today. 
  - What are your technical goals today?  Is there a particular subject you'd like to understand?
  - Is there a goal of getting better with an aspect of pairing?

3. Establish Group Norms & Workflow: 
  - How often will everyone check in with each other? What does a check in look like?
  - What is our exact git workflow process?
  - Is it okay to leave right after core hours or does everyone expect to stay later together? (for solidarity sake)
  - How should a group member bring something up that isn't working? (e.g. no one listening to their ideas, not engaging the material, someone taking too much of a lead role and taking all the work and learning, etc.)
  
4. Talk about skill differences. 
  - How is your command of the day/weeks material? 
  - Taking the risk to name skill differences up front allows the group to navigate these differences so that no one feels left disengaged with the material.
  
5. Agree on ways to celebrate success and deal effectively w/ frustration and blockages (and follow through!)


## During Working

1.  Close email, chats and turn off notifications.
2.  Using a journal or whiteboard to jot down notes can be a great tool. It allows you to continue working while keeping a log of questions you may want to ask an instructor later.
3.  Avoid non-essential conversation with others while you and your group are working. However, you and your group may want to check in with other groups to share knowledge and discuss strategies.
4.  Check in at regular intervals throughout the day to make sure above agreements are holding.
5.  If you find yourself getting stuck or spending a long time on a challenge, check-in with an instructor and determine if you should move on.

Working in groups is a huge part of your DBC experience, and it's important to think of this as a learnable skill, just like any technical proficiency you're working on. It can be very hard to become a good group member and ask others to do the same, so it's best to start practicing these habits early, and stick with them each day.

That said, sometimes the difficulty comes from a toxic interpersonal dynamic.

If you are finding that a specific group dynamic is so difficult that it is actively hindering your ability to learn anything at all, please let your cohort lead know right away.


## Follow Up

1. Give Feedback  
  - Make it actionable, specific and kind.
  - Remember to distinguish between impact and intention.  (Don't assume your pair's intention when describing the impact it had on you).
  - Be authentic and be specific about positive feedback.
